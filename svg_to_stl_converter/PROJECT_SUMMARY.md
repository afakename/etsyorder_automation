# SVG to STL Converter - Project Summary

## What I Built

A complete standalone SVG to STL/3MF converter for your 3D printing workflow with fixed dimensions (112mm longest side × 3.8mm depth).

## Key Features

### Technical Capabilities
- ✅ Parses complex SVG paths and Bezier curves
- ✅ Preserves holes and cutouts (compound paths)
- ✅ Handles multiple separate shapes in one SVG
- ✅ Maintains fine details and thin lines
- ✅ Automatic aspect ratio preservation
- ✅ Exports both STL and 3MF formats

### Fixed Dimensions (Every Time)
- Longest side (X or Y): **112mm**
- Shorter side: **Proportionally scaled**
- Extrusion depth (Z): **3.8mm**

### Libraries Used
- **trimesh** - 3D mesh creation and export
- **svgpathtools** - Parse SVG paths and curves
- **shapely** - 2D geometry operations and hole handling
- **numpy** - Numerical operations

## How It Works

### Conversion Process
1. **Parse SVG** → Read all paths from the file
2. **Extract Shapes** → Convert curves to dense polygons
3. **Handle Holes** → Use boolean operations to preserve cutouts
4. **Scale** → Proportionally scale to 112mm longest side
5. **Extrude** → Create solid 3.8mm thick mesh
6. **Export** → Save as both STL and 3MF

### Example Dimensions
- Square design (100×100) → **112mm × 112mm × 3.8mm**
- Wide design (200×100) → **112mm × 56mm × 3.8mm**
- Tall design (100×200) → **56mm × 112mm × 3.8mm**

## Usage Modes

### 1. Command Line
```bash
python converter.py design.svg
```

### 2. Drag-and-Drop (after Automator setup)
- Drag SVG file onto script icon
- Or right-click → Quick Actions → Convert SVG to STL

### 3. Batch Processing
```bash
for svg in *.svg; do python converter.py "$svg"; done
```

## Setup Instructions (for Mac)

### Quick Setup:
```bash
cd svg_to_stl_converter
bash setup_mac.sh
```

This automatically:
- Creates virtual environment
- Installs all dependencies
- Tests installation
- Makes scripts executable

### Manual Setup:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python test_installation.py
```

## Testing

### Test with included example:
```bash
python converter.py examples/test_snowflake.svg
```

Expected output:
- `test_snowflake.stl`
- `test_snowflake.3mf`

### Test with your actual file:
```bash
python converter.py "/Users/afakename/DocumentsMac/Snowflake_Database/Snowflake_Designs/Snowflake SVGs/Annette ms flk 2025.svg"
```

## Integration Notes

This converter is **standalone** for now, making it easy to:
- Test and validate independently
- Use manually during your design workflow
- Eventually integrate into the full automation pipeline

### Future Integration Points:
1. Could be called after design creation
2. Could batch-process entire directories
3. Could integrate with Etsy upload automation
4. Could be triggered by file watcher

## Next Steps for You

1. **On your Mac, navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/etsyorder_automation/svg_to_stl_converter
   ```

2. **Run the setup:**
   ```bash
   bash setup_mac.sh
   ```

3. **Test with the example:**
   ```bash
   python converter.py examples/test_snowflake.svg
   ```

4. **Test with your actual snowflake SVG:**
   ```bash
   python converter.py "/Users/afakename/DocumentsMac/Snowflake_Database/Snowflake_Designs/Snowflake SVGs/Annette ms flk 2025.svg"
   ```

5. **Import the STL into your slicer to verify:**
   - Check dimensions (should be 112mm longest side)
   - Check thickness (should be 3.8mm)
   - Verify holes/cutouts are preserved

6. **(Optional) Set up Automator for drag-and-drop:**
   - Follow instructions in `AUTOMATOR_SETUP.md`

## Questions to Ask During Testing

When you test with your actual snowflake files:

1. **Are the dimensions correct?** (112mm × proportional × 3.8mm)
2. **Are holes preserved?** (cutouts in compound paths)
3. **Are fine details captured?** (thin lines, small features)
4. **Does it handle your typical designs?** (various shapes and complexities)

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions are documented in `README.md`, including:
- Python installation problems
- Dependency installation errors
- SVG parsing issues
- Hole/cutout problems

## Git Status

✅ Committed and pushed to branch: `claude/svg-to-stl-converter-011CUdcsRA7MKSckzr9fGeDj`

All files are version controlled and ready to merge when you're satisfied with the results.
